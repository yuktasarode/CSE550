# CSE550 Combinatorial Algorithms

Various navigation services provide users with the ability to follow the shortest path from their source to their destination. However, in a state like Arizona, where there is a very high skin cancer rate, avoiding the sun is a major priority for pedestrians. I proposed a system that presents a weight factor balancing between distance and sun exposure. I presented a multi-parameter variant of the Shortest Path called the 'Compound Shortest-Path' that accounts for sunlight intensity. I defined all the components of this new method along with different variants and their respective trade-offs. I introduced the LP for this problem and solved it using Dijkstra's Algorithm, a Primal-Dual algorithm. This approach proved the feasibility of the LP and provided the optimal solution in the same time as the Shortest-Path. Finally, I discussed the limitations of this approach and possible future work.
